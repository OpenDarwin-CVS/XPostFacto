<p>While Apple has limited its support for Mac OS X to those machines that originally came with a G3 or G4 processor, it is possible to install Mac OS X on some earlier machines. The unsupported machines that work now are the 7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500 and 9600, as well the clones that were based on one of these systems (the Umax S900 and J700, and many of the Power Computing models). Other models that use the PCI architecture may be made to work in time. Version 2.2 of XPostFacto adds limited support for the original Powerbook G3, the 3400, and the 2400.

<p>I am also now working on Panther support (i.e. Mac OS X 10.3), both for the models that XPostFacto currently supports and for the Beige G3 and "Wallstreet" Powerbooks. It is unlikely that I will have Panther support completed for Panther's ship date (of October 24), because Apple has not yet released the Panther source code. However, I do not expect a long delay before Panther support is available.

<p>XPostFacto is an open-source application which you can download and try without registration. However, I would encourage you to become a <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/Billing_Form.cfm">registered user</a> of XPostFacto, which costs $10. This will give you access to the <a href="/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/forum">tech support forum</a> on this site. I do also answer e-mail, but I catch up on the tech support forum before I catch up on e-mail.

<p>XPostFacto 3.0 has been in the works for quite a while. An alpha version is now <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/framework.cfm?page=XPostFacto3.html">available to registered users</a>, and I'm working hard to get it to the beta stage. The major new features will be:

<ul>
<li>Support for booting Mac OS X from Firewire drives.
<li>Integrated L2 and L3 cache support.
<li>Support for booting from utility CDs.
<li>Redesigned user interface
<li>Runs in Mac OS X as well as Mac OS 9
<li>... and more ...
</ul>
