<p>While Apple has limited its support for Mac OS X to those machines that originally came with a G3 or G4 processor, it is possible to install Mac OS X on some earlier machines. The unsupported machines that work now are the 7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500 and 9600, as well the clones that were based on one of these systems (the Umax S900 and J700, and many of the Power Computing models). Other models that use the PCI architecture may be made to work in time. Version 2.2 of XPostFacto adds limited support for the original Powerbook G3, the 3400, and the 2400.

<p>XPostFacto itself is a free, open-source application. However, I would encourage you to <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/Billing_Form.cfm">register for XPostFacto support</a>, which costs $10. This will give you access to the <a href="/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/forum">tech support forum</a> on this site. I do also answer e-mail, but I will catch up on the tech support forum before I catch up on e-mail.

<p>XPostFacto 3.0 has been in the works for quite a while--it's a long story. I'm working on the following features:

<ul>
<li>Support for booting Mac OS X from Firewire drives.
<li>Integrated L2 and L3 cache support.
<li>Support for a couple of new models.
<li> ... and more
</ul>

<p>I am also now working on Panther support.

<p>Here's a screenshot of the new user interface (a work in progress).
