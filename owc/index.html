<p>While Apple has limited its support for Mac OS X to those machines that originally came with a G3 or G4 processor, it is possible to install Mac OS X on some earlier machines. The unsupported machines that work now are the 7300, 7500, 7600, 8500, 8600, 9500 and 9600, as well the clones that were based on one of these systems (the Umax S900 and J700, and many of the Power Computing models). Other models that use the PCI architecture may be made to work in time. Version 2.2 of XPostFacto adds limited support for the original Powerbook G3, the 3400, and the 2400.

<p>XPostFacto is an open-source application which you can download and try without registration. However, I would encourage you to become a <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/Billing_Form.cfm">registered user</a> of XPostFacto. This will give you access to the <a href="http://anybox.owc.net/forum/">tech support forum</a> on this site. I do also answer e-mail, but I catch up on the tech support forum before I catch up on e-mail.

<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/framework.cfm?page=XPostFacto3.html">XPostFacto 3 documentation</a>.
