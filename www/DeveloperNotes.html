<h2>XPostFacto Developer Notes</h2>

<p>Here are some things you will need to know in order to build XPostFacto successfully. And I will probably forget some details, so feel free to ask if you run into trouble.

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Building XPostFacto involves both a XCode project and a CodeWarrior project. The XCode project has targets for building the following items:

<ol>
<p><li>Each kernel extension which XPostFacto installs.

<p><li>A customized version of BootX, with a shell script to convert the product to xcoff format and copy the xcoff to the CodeWarrior project.

<p><li>The hfsplusarchive tool, which packages folders into an archive that XPostFacto knows how to unpack and install, with all HFS+ metadata intact.

<p><li>An xpfbootsupportd daemon, which is part of the XPFStartupItem, which copies changes from a "root" disk to a "helper" disk (this is new in XPF 3).

<p><li>A "Package" target, which (through dependencies) builds everything else, and has a shell script which packages up everything for the CodeWarrior project.
</ol>

<p>The XPostFacto folder contains the CodeWarrior project, which builds the application called XPostFacto. The "Derived" folder in the CodeWarrior project is special. It is where the ProjectBuilder project copies the bootx.xcoff and the kernel extensions (as archived by hfsplusarchive).

<p>The CodeWarrior project is checked into the repository as an XML export. So you will need to import the XML file into CodeWarrior in order to get a working project. What I do is save the resulting project file as XPostFacto.mcp, in the same folder as the XML file.

<p>As of XPF 3, XPostFacto runs in both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X. The Mac OS 9 version builds as a non-Carbon application (because that makes certain parts of the code easier--some things I need aren't in Carbon). The Mac OS X version builds as mach-o, for the same reason (I need to link to some frameworks that are mach-o frameworks). I'm using CodeWarrior 8.3.

<p>The main dependency that is not included in the XPostFacto sources is MacApp. The XPostFacto application is based on MacApp. So you will need to download MacApp, and build its libraries, both in Mac OS 9 and in Mac OS X. Also, you'll need to define a "source tree" in CodeWarrior to point to the MacApp sources. The easiest way to do this is to do it in the general CodeWarrior preferences, rather than in a specific project. So you would define a source tree with the name "MacApp", and, in my case, it points to:

<p>/Users/ryan/Projects/ClubMacApp/sources/macapp.15.1.1

<p>I am using the latest MacApp. In fact, I am using the MacApp sources from ClubMacApp, which is a subscription-based service with continuing source modifications. The background is that Apple has dropped further development of MacApp, but a community of MacApp users keeps things updated through ClubMacApp.

<p>The unfortunate part of that is that I cannot redistribute the latest MacApp changes myself, so to build the latest MacApp you need to subscribe. It is possible that I could distribute patch files with the most important changes, and I should look into that. I think it may be possible to build the Mac OS 9 version of XPostFacto with a "stock" MacApp, but the mach-o version probably requires some of the later changes.

<p>I originally picked MacApp (at a time it was still being developed by Apple), rather than PowerPlant, for reasons that seemed sensible at the time. It's a little awkward now, but rewriting for PowerPlant would be a ton of work, and I'm not really planning to do it. I suppose there is something appropriate about developing XPostFacto with a framework that Apple has abandoned :-)

<p>It is also worth mentioning that XPostFacto requires Mac OS 9 or later. The reason is that the APIs for dealing with HFS+ volumes only became available in Mac OS 9. This is important in two respects. First, it permits XPostFacto to copy files with long filenames from the Mac OS X Install CD. Second, it permits XPostFacto to preserve unix-style permissions when it copies files (and unarchives them).

<h4>The Build Process</h4>

<p>So, assuming that you have MacApp downloaded and you have built its libraries, here's the rest of the build process:

<ol>
<p><li>The FixTypesAndCreators.sh file is a shell script for setting types and creators to what CodeWarrior expects. You would run it this way. Generally, you would only have to do this when you first check files out of the cvs repository.

<p>sh FixTypesAndCreators.sh

<p><li>Build BootX and all the kernel extensions, so the CodeWarrior project can use them. The easiest way to do that is with this command (executed in this directory):

<p>sudo xcodebuild install

<p>You need to use sudo, because we want the kernel extensions to be owned by root. The kernel extensions will initially be "installed" under /tmp somewhere, but the "Package" target has a shell script that archives them for the CodeWarrior project to use. (The shell script in the "Package" target also resets the ownership of some files back to you, rather than root--this makes it easier to build things as yourself later, or just to delete the built files).

<p><li>Open the XPostFacto.mcp CodeWarrior project, and make the "Application" target. This builds both the Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X versions. Or you can build individual targets if you like.

<p>You can build individual kernel extensions within XCode for testing purposes. But once you want to incorporate them into XPostFacto, you will need to repeat the "sudo pbxbuild install" step (and then rebuild XPostFacto). (For BootX, you need not perform the "sudo pbxbuild install"--building it within XCode is sufficient).
</ol>

<h4>Quirks</h4>

<p>Here are some random quirks that you may want to know about.

<h4>Panther</h4>

<p>I'm building in Mac OS X 10.3 with XCode now. To do this, you need to install the 10.1.5 SDK, along with the gcc 2.95. This is in order to build kernel extensions that will function back to 10.1 (and 10.0 in fact).

<p>Also, if you are using CodeWarrior 8.3, you need to set your "Mac OS X Volume" source tree to point at the 10.2 SDK.

<h4>Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 Headers</h4>

<p>You will notice that a variety of headers are included in the CompatibleKernelHeaders directory. Each of the kernel extension targets is set up to use those headers (by having CompatibleKernelHeaders included in the header search paths). The reason is that these are the Mac OS X 10.0 version (or in some cases, 10.1) of these headers, and using them permits the kernel extensions to load in both Mac OS X 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2.

<p>Another 10.0 vs. 10.1 issue worth noting is that PatchedIOSCSICDDrive only loads in 10.0, while PatchedSCSIDeviceType05 only loads in 10.1. In Mac OS X 10.2, neither of them loads, and they do not appear to be needed.

<h4>Kernel Extension Status</h4>

<p>Most of the kernel extensions are taken from Darwin sources from Mac OS X public beta vintage, with a variety of bug fixes and updates required to keep them working.

<p>The PowerStarCPU.kext represents an attempt to get sleep working on the powerbooks. It isn't working yet.

<p>The PowerSurgeCPU.kext represents an attempt to get 604MP support working. It isn't working yet either.

<p>The PatchedIOSSCICDDrive.kext and PatchedSCSIDeviceType05.kext work around certain problems in SCSI CD support in Mac OS X. There are still some problems with some CD-ROM devices that could probably be fixed.

<p>PatchedNVRAM.kext fixes a problem reading and writing NVRAM on older machines.

<p>OpenPMU.kext is based on the last open-source version of the ApplePMU driver. (Unfortunately, the current version is not open source, and the current binary included in Mac OS X panics on older systems).

<p>PatchedNDRVSupport.kext works around a 10.2 problem with the cursor on the built-in video in the 7300 etc.

<h4>XPostFacto Resource Files</h4>

<p>The "Shared Resources" target in CodeWarrior builds a SharedResources.rsrc file that is put in the application package where both the Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X versions can use it. The resources are built out of various .r files.

<p>Of particular interest are the files located in XPostFacto/Resources/Views. These are all .r files that you might want to edit in a binary form (i.e. icons, views, picts). In order to facilitate this, there is a Makefile there which helps with the conversion between .r and .rsrc files. Basically, you can "make" either the .r or .rsrc file, and the Makefile will do the right thing.

<p>For instance, you can "cd" to the directory, and then type "make XPFProgressWindow.rsrc". The Makefile will then run Rez to generate XPFProgressWindow.rsrc from the .r file. You can then edit the resource file with a resource editor (like AdLib or IcePick). However, it is still the .r file that is compiled into the application. So once you've done you're editing, you would "make" the .r file (i.e. "make XPFProgressWindow.r"). This then runs DeRez to turn XPFProgressWindow.rsrc into XPFProgressWindow.r.

<p>Rez and Derez need access to the MacApp ViewTypes.r file in order for this to work. But the Makefile doesn't know where you've put it. The easiest way to fix this is for you to copy the ViewTypes.r file into that directory. Alternatively, you could alter the Makefile, or you could use the RIncludes environment variable to point to the directory that ViewTypes.r is in. I suppose I could have a ViewTypes.r target in the Makefile that would look for the ViewTypes.r file and copy it.

<h4>CVS Integration</h4>

<p>If you create or edit files to put in the cvs repository, it seems best to use Unix line endings.

<h4>That's All</h4>

<p>Those are all the notes that occur to me at the moment. I should probably write up some notes about the way the XPostFacto CodeWarrior application is structured, but I will put that in a separate document when I do it.
