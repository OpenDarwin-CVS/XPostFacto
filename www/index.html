<h2>XPostFacto</h2>

<p>Welcome to the development site for XPostFacto, the software that permits you to install Mac OS X on certain unsupported systems.

<p>For basic information about XPostFacto (for instance, which systems it supports), head over to <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/framework.cfm?page=XPostFacto.html">Other World Computing's</a> web site. That's where you can <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/OSXCenter/XPostFacto/framework.cfm?page=XPostFacto.html">download the application</a>. OWC has provided very generous support for the development of XPostFacto.

<p>XPostFacto is an open-source application, and the code is hosted here in the OpenDarwin CVS repository. You can browse the code via the <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/projects/XPostFacto/">CVSWeb interface</a>, but for serious work you will want to set up for <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/doc/en/articles/opendarwin/cvs_howto/">anonymous CVS access</a>. Once you've got that set up, you can do something like "cvs co projects/XPostFacto" to get the source. As usual, the "top of tree" won't always be completely coherent, but I do tag each release, including the alpha and beta releases. I have written some <a href="DeveloperNotes.html">developer notes</a> to help you figure out how to compile the source. 

You can also <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-xpostfacto-all">sign up to receive e-mail</a> when XPF source is checked into the CVS repository.

<p>You can report bugs in XPostFacto using the <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/bugzilla/index.php">OpenDarwin Bugzilla</a> (look first to see whether there is already a bug open for your problem). Scroll down in the product list until you hit "XPostFacto." You can also sign up to receive e-mail from the Bugzilla about individual bugs, or when new bugs are created etc.
