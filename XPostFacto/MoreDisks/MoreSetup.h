Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.


        <12>     21/9/01    Quinn   Fix CF framework includes workaround.
        <11>     21/9/01    Quinn   Changes for CWPro7 Mach-O build.
        <10>     15/2/01    Quinn   MoreIsBetter now requires UI 3.4 (pre-release) or later.
         <9>      8/2/01    Quinn   Modern versions of MIB require UI 3.3.2 or higher.
         <8>    22/11/00    Quinn   Switch to "MacErrors.h".
         <7>     22/4/99    Quinn   Add a check for the Universal Interfaces version.  MoreIsBetter
                                    requires Universal Interfaces 3.2 or higher (because many of its
                                    component parts do).
         <6>     2/11/99    PCG     add comments because Andy rightfully pointed out my original
                                    attempts sucked; also, remove some excessive TARGET_CARBON
                                    gymnastics
         <5>     1/22/99    PCG     TARGET_CARBON
         <4>    11/11/98    PCG     fix header
         <3>    11/10/98    PCG     separate change histories
         <2>    10/11/98    Quinn   Convert "MorePrefix.h" to "MoreSetup.h".
         <1>    10/11/98    Quinn   Changed name from "MorePrefix.h" to "MoreSetup.h".

	Start of "MorePrefix.h" change history (most recent first):

         <3>     5/11/98    Quinn   Use MoreAssertQ instead of MoreAssert.
         <2>     7/24/98    PCG	    rid of triplet #includes
         <2>     6/23/98    PCG     add copyright disclaimer stuff

	//	We need a master conditional to determine whether to use 
	//	framework notation to reference include files.  Normally 
	//	you would define this in terms of the various TARGET_xxx
	//	variables defined in <ConditionalMacros.h>.  However, you 
	//	can't include <ConditionalMacros.h> until you know 
	//	whether you're supposed to be using framework includes or 
	//	not.  So, we have to pull this conditional out of thin 
	//	air.  Right now the best way to do this is with the 
	//	__MACH__ compiler variable.

	//	include case we just include <Carbon/Carbon.h>, which 
	//	brings everything in, including <ConditionalMacros.h>.

	//	in Mac OS X 10.1.  CF is assuming that the CW Mach-O compiler 
	//	would not use framework includes, which is not the case for the 
	//	CWPro7 compiler.  We only do this for the CW build because 
    //	otherwise the presence of the define prevents Project Builder 
    //	from using Carbon's precompiled header.
