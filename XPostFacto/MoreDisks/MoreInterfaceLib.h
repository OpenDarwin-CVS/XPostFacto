Revision 1.14  2001/11/07 15:52:55  eskimo1
Tidy up headers, add CVS logs, update copyright.


        <13>     21/9/01    Quinn   Changes for CWPro7 Mach-O build.
        <12>     15/2/01    Quinn   Fixes to allow the header file to be included by Project Builder
                                    as part of building a Carbon application.
        <11>    22/12/00    Quinn   Added compatibility for some Mac OS 8.5 toolbox routines.
        <10>    16/11/00    Quinn   Add a temporary fix to allow Carbon applications to call
                                    MoreBlockZero. Long term I need to come up with a better
                                    solution, but this is it for the moment.
         <9>      6/3/00    Quinn   Added modern Time Manager interfaces.
         <8>     16/9/99    Quinn   Add FSM FCB accessors.
         <7>     15/6/99    Quinn   Added MoreBlockZero.
         <6>     15/6/99    Quinn   Added Extended Disk Init Package routines.
         <5>     22/4/99    Quinn   Added PBRemoteAccess.
         <4>     20/4/99    Quinn   Added Gestalt Value routines.
         <3>     16/3/99    Quinn   Added MoreUTFindDrive and MoreAddDrive.
         <2>      1/3/99    Quinn   Added MoreFlushCodeCacheRange.  Also corrected a serious bug in
                                    MoreDriverInstallReserveMem, which was missing the #pragma
                                    parameter stuff.  Also some general tidy up.
         <1>     25/2/99    Quinn   First checked in.
