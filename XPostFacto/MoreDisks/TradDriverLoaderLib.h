You should look in//  "Designing PCI Cards and Drivers for Power Macintosh Computers" for//  documentation.  You can FTP an electronic copy from://  <http://developer.apple.com/macos/opentransport/docs/dev/Designing_PCI_Cards_Drivers.pdf>extern pascal SInt16 TradHigherDriverVersion(NumVersion *dv1, NumVersion *dv2);extern pascal UnitNumber TradHighestUnitNumber(void);extern pascal OSErr TradDriverGestaltOn(DriverRefNum refNum);extern pascal OSErr TradDriverGestaltOff(DriverRefNum refNum);extern pascal Boolean TradDriverGestaltIsOn(DriverFlags flags);extern pascal OSErr TradLookupDrivers(UnitNumber beginningUnit,										UnitNumber endingUnit,										Boolean emptyUnits,										ItemCount *returnedRefNums, 										DriverRefNum *refNums);///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// The following routines are similar to the corresponding routines in//  DriverLoaderLib, but their interface differs because of the//  inherent differences between 'DRVR's and 'ndrv's.  The comments//  cover the differences for each routine.  If there's a difference//  that's not commented, it's most probably a bug and you should let//  me know.extern pascal OSErr TradInstallDriverFromPtr(DRVRHeaderPtr driver,												UnitNumber beginningUnit,												UnitNumber endingUnit,												DriverRefNum *refNum);	// This routine is similar to InstallDriverFromMemory except	//  that you pass a pointer to the 'DRVR', rather than a base pointer	//  and length.  This pointer is copied verbatim into the dCtlDriver	//  field of the DCE, so you have to make sure that it's in	//  the system heap if the driver is going to hang around longer than	//  your application.	// One other deviation from InstallDriverFromMemory is that this	//  call won't replace an existing driver.  This is because 'DRVR's	//  don't have infrastructure to support this.  If there's already	//  a driver of the same name in the unit table, the call will fail	//  with a dupFNErr, and *refNum will be set to the refnum of the	//  existing driver.	// The semantics of the endingUnit match those of DriverLoaderLib,	//  ie the call will not grow the unit table unless endingUnit is	//  greater than TradHighestUnitNumber.  The simplest way to work	//  this is to pass TradHighestUnitNumber() + 1 to endingUnit.	// If the call fails, it's your responsibility to dispose of the	//  the driver pointer.  If it succeeds, the system has a copy	//  of the pointer, which can be disposed by calling TradRemoveDriver.extern pascal OSErr TradInstallDriverFromHandle(DRVRHeaderHandle driver,												UnitNumber beginningUnit,												UnitNumber endingUnit,												DriverRefNum *refNum);	// This routine is similar to InstallDriverFromMemory except	//  that you pass a handle to the 'DRVR', rather than a base pointer	//  and length.  This is generally more convenient in the traditional	//  'DRVR' world.	// In most other respects, this routine works like TradInstallDriverFromPtr.	//  The routine simply creates a pointer in the system heap and copies	//  your driver into it, then calls TradInstallDriverFromPtr.  Because	//  a copy is made, you do not have to ensure that the handle you	//  pass in is in the system heap.	// Regardless of whether call succeeds or fails, it's your responsibility	//  to dispose of the driver handle.	extern pascal OSErr TradInstallDriverFromResource(SInt16 rsrcID, StringPtr rsrcName,												UnitNumber beginningUnit,												UnitNumber endingUnit,												DriverRefNum *refNum);	// This call offers functionality like InstallDriverFromFile.	//  It differs from InstallDriverFromFile in that the driver is expected	//  to be in a resource in the current resource file.  If rsrcName is nil,	//  the call uses Get1Resource('DRVR', rsrcID) to get the driver.  If	//  rsrcName is not nil, it uses Get1NamedResource('DRVR', rsrcName)	//  to get the driver.	// In most other respects, this routine works like TradInstallDriverFromPtr.	// If the call fails, the routine will clean up after itself.  If the	//  call succeeds, the driver code is left as a memory block in the system	//  heap, which can be cleaned up by calling TradRemoveDriver.extern pascal OSErr TradGetDriverInformation(DriverRefNum refNum,												UnitNumber *thisUnit,												DriverFlags *flags,												StringPtr name,												DRVRHeaderPtr *driverHeader												);	// This routine is like GetDriverInformation except that it only	//  returns information that's pertinant to the traditional 'DRVR'	//  world.  driverHeader comes back as a pointer to the beginning	//  of the 'DRVR' header.	// Note that this routine works for both drivers installed by	//  this library and other drivers, however for drivers not installed	//  by this library (ie 'RAM'-based drivers), driverHeader may be a 	//  half dereferenced handle, locked or unlocked.  You have been warned.	// Also, driverHeader can come back set to nil, if the driver	//  is installed but its code has been purged, for example a DA.	//  You must check for this before deferencing it.  If driverHeader	//  is set to nil, name will be set to the empty string.extern pascal OSErr TradOpenInstalledDriver(DriverRefNum refNum, SInt8 ioPermission);	// This routine has the same semantics as OpenInstalledDriver	//  except that the ioPermission parameter must be fsRdWrPerm.  This is	//  because we call through to the Device Manager's OpenDriver routine,	//  and that doesn't support passing in permissions.  I could switch the	//  implementation to use PBOpen, but PBOpen is a trap fraught with much	//  danger, so I'm avoiding it at the moment.	// The danger associated with PBOpen is that it's highly overloaded,	//  being used for FSOpen, PBOpen, PBHOpen, OpenSlot, OpenDriver,	//  OpenDeskAcc, and so on.  If you get the glue wrong, you die in	//  strange and evil ways.  So I'm bypassing the entire problem by	//  ignoring ioPermission.  I may revisit this decision, but not soon.extern pascal OSErr TradRemoveDriver(DriverRefNum refNum, Boolean immediate);	// This routine implements similar semantics to RemoveDriver, except	//  that the Immediate parameter must be false.  This is because	//  we close the driver using PBCloseSync, which is a queued	//  command, just like all the others.  We have no way to bypass	//  this.	// An important thing to note is that you should only call this on drivers	//  you installed using this library's TradInstallDriverFromHandle	//  and TradInstallDriverFromResource routine.  Don't call it on	//  drivers installed by other people and be careful when calling it on	//  drivers installed using TradInstallDriverFromPtr because you might	//  be disposing the driver code even though a) it might not actually be a	//  Memory Manager pointer block, or b) it might be still in use	//  by another driver.extern pascal OSErr TradRenameDriver(DriverRefNum refNum, ConstStr255Param newDriverName);	// This routine is implemented with the caveat that you can't	//  make the driver name longer.  This is because the 'DRVR'	//  name is actually stored in the code resource which implements	//  the driver, and making it longer would cause it to run into	//  the code that immediately follows the name.	// The reason why I implemented this routine at all is because	//  it's useful for installing multiple copies of the same driver.	//  For example, you can install ".Q_Out", then rename it to	//  ".QAOut", and then install ".Q_Out" again, and rename that to	//  ".QBOut".  This can be very useful when testing and debugging	//  your driver (or TradDriverLoaderLib for that matter :).	// You should take extreme care when calling this routine on drivers that	//  weren't installed with this library.  Some of these drivers might	//  not like being renamed in this way.///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// The following routines from DriverLoaderLib were not implemented because//  they make no sense at all in the world of 'DRVR's.// VerifyFragmentAsDriver// GetDriverMemoryFragment// GetDriverDiskFragment// InstallDriverFromFragment// SetDriverClosureMemory// -- If they've got fragment in the name, it's hard to map them into the// 'DRVR' world.  Traditional 'DRVR's just aren't code fragments!// InstallDriverFromFile -- This routine assumes that there's only//	one driver in a file, which is not the case for traditional 'DRVR's//  which are normally stored as resources.  The basic functionality has//  been subsumed by TradInstallDriverFromResource.// InstallDriverFromDisk// FindDriversForDevice// FindDriverCandidates// ScanDriverCandidates// GetDriverForDevice// InstallDriverForDevice// -- These routines all assume that there's some magic way of matching//  drivers to their name register nodes.  In the traditional world, there//  is no name registry and, even if there was, there's no way to match//  devices against hardware.  So these routines are not sensible in the//  traditional world. // ReplaceDriverWithFragment -- There's no good way to replace a traditional//  device driver; the infrastructure just isn't there.#ifdef __cplusplus}#endif
